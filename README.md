# The-Alternating-Disk-Problem
You have a row of 𝟐𝒏 disks of two colors, 𝒏 light and 𝒏 dark. They alternate: light, dark, light, dark, and so on. You want to get all the dark disks to the left hand side and all the light disks to the right hand end. The only moves you are allowed to make are those that interchange the positions of two neighboring disks. Design an algorithm for solving this puzzle and determine the number of moves it takes.
